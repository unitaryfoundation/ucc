# Trigger an upgrade of ucc version  in ucc-bench repo in response to push to main
# To trigger an event in the other repo, we had to install a GitHub app in the
# ucc-bench repo, and then add the app ID/private key as secrets to this repo
# so it could trigger the workflow. See
# https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/automating-projects-using-actions
# for details.
