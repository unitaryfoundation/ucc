The **Unitary Compiler Collection (UCC)** is a Python library for frontend-agnostic, high performance compilation of quantum circuits. UCC's goal is to gather together the best of open source compilation to make quantum programming simpler, faster, and more scalable.

By leveraging [qBraid](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid), UCC interfaces automatically with multiple quantum computing frameworks, including [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq), and [PyTKET](https://github.com/CQCL/tket) and supports programs in OpenQASM 2 and [OpenQASM 3](https://openqasm.com/). For a full list of the latest supported interfaces, just call `ucc.supported_circuit_formats`.


**Want to know more?**
- Check out our [documentation](https://ucc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which you can build locally after installation by running `make html` in `ucc/docs/source`.
- Read the [launch announcement](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2025_ucc_launch_blog) to learn more on the current state of UCC, its capabilities and future direction.

## Quickstart

### Installation

**Note**: UCC requires Python version ≥ 3.12.

```bash
pip install ucc
```

If developing or running benchmarks, please install [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/install.python-poetry.org), which is used to managed dependencies. Then setup a dev version via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unitaryfund/ucc.git
cd ucc
poetry install
```
For any subsequent commands mentioned in the docs, we assume you either prefix each command with `poetry run`, or
you first activate the [poetry managed virtual environment](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#activating-the-environment>) by running the output of `poetry env activate` in your shell.


### Example with Qiskit, Cirq, and PyTKET

Define a circuit with your preferred quantum SDK and compile it!

```python
from ucc import compile

from pytket import Circuit as TketCircuit
from cirq import Circuit as CirqCircuit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit as QiskitCircuit
from cirq import H, CNOT, LineQubit

def test_tket_compile():
    circuit = TketCircuit(2)
    circuit.H(0)
    circuit.CX(0, 1)
    compile(circuit)

def test_qiskit_compile():
    circuit = QiskitCircuit(2)
    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    compile(circuit)

def test_cirq_compile():
    qubits = LineQubit.range(2)
    circuit = CirqCircuit(
        H(qubits[0]),
        CNOT(qubits[0], qubits[1]))
    compile(circuit)
```

## How does UCC stack up?

UCC seeks to provide an end-to-end compiler that works well for the majority of the users out of the box. Today, this is achieved by building on and customizing [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit) transpiler passes. To ensure these customizations improve performance and meet user needs, we regularly run benchmarks comparing UCC against the latest versions of leading quantum compiler frameworks across a range of circuits. Here’s the latest:

In addition to raw compilation stats, we simulate the compiled circuits with a noisy density matrix simulation to see how each compiler impacts performance.
Here we plot the absolute errors $|\langle O\rangle_{C_i,\text{ideal}} - \langle O\rangle_{C_i,\text{noisy}}|$ for a collection of circuits $C_i$.

![Violin plot showing absolute error of each compiler across a variety of circuits](benchmarks/latest_expval_benchmark_by_compiler.png)

And here you can see progress over time, with new package versions labeled for each compiler:
![alt text](benchmarks/avg_compiler_benchmarks_over_time.png)
Note that the compile times before 2024-12-10 may have been run on different classical compute instances, so their runtime is not reported here, but you can find this data in benchmarks/results.
After 2024-12-10, all data present in this plot is on the same compute instance using our [ucc-benchmarks](https://github.com/unitaryfund/ucc/blob/main/.github/workflows/ucc-benchmarks.yml) GitHub Actions workflow.
